CrowdStrike BSOD ruining your the weekend of lot of people on Friday Morning on 19th July The CrowdStrike is causing your blue screen on Computers and Servers, I have created a WinPE Boot ISO which will fix the issue for only non encrypted disks. I have automated the process, so now you dont need to go to safe mode and rename the crowd strike file C-00000291*.sys
We have created script to will run during the startup. 
That script will find the file C-00000291*.sys and will rename it.
